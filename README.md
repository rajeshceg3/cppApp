# cppApp

## CppApp

A simple C++ application using Conan for package management and CMake for building.

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- CMake (version 3.15 or higher)
- Conan (latest version recommended)

### Building and Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd CppApp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using Conan:**
    This command installs dependencies specified in `conanfile.py`. The `-s compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11` flag might be necessary on Linux to ensure ABI compatibility, adjust as needed for your compiler and OS.
    ```bash
    conan install . --build=missing -s compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 
    ```

3.  **Configure the project using CMake:**
    This command configures the build system. The `conan_toolchain.cmake` file generated by Conan helps CMake find the installed dependencies.
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../conan_toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    ```
    *Note: After running `conan install .` in the project root, the `conan_toolchain.cmake` file will be generated in the project root. The CMake command above correctly references it from within the `build` directory.*


4.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    cmake --build . --config Release
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    The executable `app` (or `app.exe` on Windows) will be located in the `build` directory (or `build/Release` for multi-config generators like Visual Studio).
    ```bash
    ./app 
    ```
    Or on Windows:
    ```bash
    Release\app.exe
    ```

### CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. It automatically builds and tests the application on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.
